## The Data Lakehouse - A Modern Scalable, Agile Data Management, and Analytics Solutions

_traditional data warehouses are awesome, but they are rigid, with rigidity comes lack of agility_

## What is Synapse?

Simply, Azure Synapse is an umbrella of highly integrated, multiple Azure Data services. 

Expanded, Azure Synapse is a unified analytics service that brings data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics together. 

This can help us build a data lakehouse.

## What is a Lakehouse?


## Why a Lakehouse?

A Lakehouse brings the best of data warehousing and data lakes together.

## Data Warehouse Pros

- Highly curated and structured data
- Reliable data model
- Data governance

## Data Warehouse Cons

- Structured data sources now only account for 20% of organizations' data. 
 - There is data available in various file formats like CSV, JSON, and log files. 
 - There is data from NoSQL databases, from audio and video files, and then there is streaming data as well. 
 - These unstructured and streaming data sources account for 80% of organizations' data.

## Azure Synapse Analytics is not Azure SQL Data Warehouse

But then came Azure Synapse Analytics (Workspaces) in May 2020, causing a lot of confusion. Now this is a totally new product. It has a new development workspace, multiple Azure data services are integrated into this, and it also has SQL DW inside it with the name of dedicated SQL pool. 

confusion was cleared in November 2020. Workspaces keyword was removed, and the new product with multiple services is now called Azure Synapse Analytics. An MPP‑based dedicated SQL pool exists as a standalone service, and it is also available within Synapse.
